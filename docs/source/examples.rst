Usage Examples
==============

The following examples demonstrate how to use FISSA by applying it to a toy dataset.

The examples are each generated with a Jupyter notebooks, which you can run locally by downloading them from the `corresponding directory in our repository <notebooks_source_>`_.
Alternatively, they can be run in the cloud using Binder_. |Binder|

The Suite2p notebook, which has more complicated dependencies, is not located with the other notebooks and can be found in its own `example repository <Suite2p_repo_>`_.
