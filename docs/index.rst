FISSA Documentation
===================

FISSA (Fast Image Signal Separation Analysis) is a Python package for
decontaminating somatic signals from two-photon calcium imaging data.
It can read images in tiff format and ROIs from zip files exported by ImageJ_;
or operate on numpy arrays, generated by importing files stored in other
or as the output of other packages.

For details of the algorithm, please see our `companion paper <doi_>`_
